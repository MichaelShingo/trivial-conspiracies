const creditsContent = <><p>It was summertime in the year 2020. We had all been living isolated, in the
                deep, dead heat of the covid-19 pandemic. I was beginning to lose faith in the
                prospects of filmmaking amidst this new covid-world. Then one day my friend
                Shae Belenski sent me a draft of his writing in a document titled: “drunk.” It was
                essentially a series of monologues, which Shae had written as “interviews” (read
                these by clicking on the “Trivial Conspiracies” button.) He was interested in
                filming some of these monologues and I jumped at the opportunity to adapt
                his writing into a film...
            </p>
            <p>For me, making this film was a creative escape from the scary reality of our
                world, but also a way of processing this reality. Conspiracy theories revolving
                around the pandemic and the 2020 presidential election were part of the
                zeitgeist of these years and this project brought some healing levity to all that
                harmful nonsense.

            <p>I write this exactly 2 years after Philadelphia locked down. I am stuck at home,
                sick with Covid-19. During my quarantine, I can’t help but reflect on the past
                two years and feel lucky to be alive, vaccinated, and grateful for the privilege to
                be creative with people amidst all the chaos.
